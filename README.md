9th of March:

Taking on the final project in the Intermediate HTML & CSS course. I feel much more confident using Grid now, whereas SoloLearn and freeCodeCamp mostly just left me confused. The page I'm tasked with replicating (cause if i try coming up with my own design i'll be stuck here till like summer) doesn't seem all that complicated, except for all the tiny elements and icons and stuff. They're going to be a pain, I can feel it...
